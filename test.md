ðŸ“‹ Tool Security Audit Report:

Below is a structured analysis of the tool descriptions, identifying potential issues that could lead to biased or incorrect tool selection by an AI model.

| **Issue Type** | **Description** | **Examples** | **Recommendations** |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|

| **1. Overlapping Functionality** | Tools that perform similar actions, potentially confusing the model. | - `browser_navigate` and `puppeteer_navigate` both navigate to a URL. <br> - `browser_take_screenshot` and `puppeteer_screenshot` both take screenshots. <br> - `browser_click` and `puppeteer_click` both perform click actions. <br> - `browser_hover` and `puppeteer_hover` both hover over elements. <br> - `browser_select_option` and `puppeteer_select` both select options in dropdowns. | Clarify distinctions between similar tools, possibly by specifying unique features or contexts where each tool is preferable. |

| **2. Influencing or Persuasive Language** | Descriptions that subtly suggest preference or priority. | - `browser_snapshot`: "this is better than screenshot" suggests a preference for `browser_snapshot` over `browser_take_screenshot`. | Use neutral language to describe tool capabilities without suggesting superiority. |

| **3. Crafted or Informal Tone** | Non-neutral wording such as second-person instructions or emotional framing. | - `browser_install`: "Call this if you get an error about the browser not being installed." <br> - `capture`: "You can use this if the human asks questions about their immediate environment, if you want to see the human or to examine an object they may be referring to or showing you." | Use formal, third-person language to maintain objectivity and neutrality. |

| **4. Attention-Seeking Wording** | Descriptions using exaggeration or marketing-style language. | - `browser_snapshot`: "this is better than screenshot" uses comparative language. | Avoid comparative or superlative language that implies one tool is superior to another. |

| **5. Predicted Precedence** | For overlapping tools, predict which tool the LLM would likely select and explain why. | - For navigation, `browser_navigate` might be selected over `puppeteer_navigate` due to the broader context of browser tools. <br> - For screenshots, `puppeteer_screenshot` might be selected due to its ability to capture specific elements, which is more detailed. <br> - For clicking, `puppeteer_click` might be selected due to the specificity of "element" in the description. | Ensure descriptions are equally detailed and specific to prevent unintended precedence. |

| **6. Inconsistency in Tone or Structure** | Descriptions that donâ€™t follow a consistent, formal, objective style. | - `browser_install` and `capture` use informal, second-person language, while most other descriptions are more formal. | Standardize the tone and structure across all tool descriptions to maintain consistency. |

**Overall Recommendations:**
- Revise tool descriptions to eliminate overlapping functionality by clearly defining unique use cases or contexts.
- Remove any language that suggests preference or superiority of one tool over another.
- Ensure all descriptions are written in a formal, third-person tone to maintain neutrality.
- Standardize the structure and style of descriptions to ensure consistency and clarity.
